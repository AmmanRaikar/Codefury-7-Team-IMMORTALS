            <h2>What is a Drought?</h2>
            <p>A drought is a prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to a shortage of water. Droughts can have severe consequences on agriculture, water supply, ecosystems, and the economy. Unlike other natural disasters, droughts develop slowly, but their effects can be long-lasting and widespread.</p>

        <section class="causes">
            <h2>Causes of Droughts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Changes in global climate patterns can alter precipitation levels, leading to more frequent and severe droughts.</li>
                <li><strong>El Niño and La Niña:</strong> These climatic phenomena can disrupt normal weather patterns, resulting in prolonged dry periods in certain regions.</li>
                <li><strong>Deforestation:</strong> Removing trees and vegetation reduces the amount of moisture in the air, contributing to drier conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Overuse of Water Resources:</strong> Excessive irrigation and water extraction from rivers, lakes, and groundwater sources can exacerbate drought conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Urbanization:</strong> Expanding cities and infrastructure can reduce the natural water retention capacity of the land, leading to drought.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        
        <section class="types">
            <h2>Types of Droughts</h2>
            <p>Droughts can be categorized into different types based on their causes and impacts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meteorological Drought:</strong> Caused by a lack of precipitation over an extended period, leading to a deficit in water availability.</li>
                <li><strong>Agricultural Drought:</strong> Occurs when soil moisture is insufficient to meet the needs of crops, resulting in reduced agricultural productivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydrological Drought:</strong> Characterized by reduced water levels in rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, affecting water supply for drinking, agriculture, and industry.</li>
                <li><strong>Socioeconomic Drought:</strong> Arises when the demand for water exceeds the available supply, impacting the economy and livelihoods.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        
        <section class="effects">
            <h2>Effects of Droughts</h2>
            <p>Droughts can have far-reaching consequences on both the environment and human life:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Water Shortages:</strong> Droughts lead to reduced water availability for drinking, agriculture, and industry, causing widespread water stress.</li>
                <li><strong>Agricultural Losses:</strong> Crops fail and livestock suffer due to lack of water, leading to food shortages and economic losses.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Droughts can lead to desertification, loss of biodiversity, and the degradation of ecosystems.</li>
                <li><strong>Health Issues:</strong> Water scarcity can lead to poor sanitation and hygiene, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Impact:</strong> The agricultural sector, which is heavily dependent on water, suffers the most, leading to financial losses and food price inflation.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="safety-tips">
            <h2>Drought Safety Tips</h2>
            <p>To mitigate the effects of drought and manage water resources effectively, follow these safety tips:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Conserve Water:</strong> Use water efficiently by fixing leaks, using water-saving appliances, and reducing water consumption in daily activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Practice Sustainable Agriculture:</strong> Implement water-efficient irrigation techniques, such as drip irrigation, and plant drought-resistant crops.</li>
                <li><strong>Harvest Rainwater:</strong> Collect and store rainwater for use during dry periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Support Reforestation:</strong> Planting trees and preserving forests can help maintain the natural water cycle and prevent desertification.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Monitor local water restrictions and follow guidelines issued by authorities during drought conditions.</li>
            </ol>
