            <h2>What is a Landslide?</h2>
            <p>A landslide is the movement of rock, earth, or debris down a slope due to gravity. It can be triggered by natural events such as heavy rainfall, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or by human activities like deforestation and construction. Landslides can cause extensive damage to property, infrastructure, and can lead to loss of life.</p>

        <section class="causes">
            <h2>Causes of Landslides</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heavy Rainfall:</strong> Intense or prolonged rain can saturate soil, reducing its stability and triggering a landslide.</li>
                <li><strong>Earthquakes:</strong> Seismic activity can loosen rocks and soil, causing them to move downslope.</li>
                <li><strong>Volcanic Activity:</strong> Volcanic eruptions can create unstable slopes that are prone to landslides.</li>
                <li><strong>Human Activities:</strong> Deforestation, mining, and construction can destabilize slopes, leading to landslides.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Composition:</strong> Certain types of soil and rock are more prone to landslides due to their composition and structure.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        
        <section class="types">
            <h2>Types of Landslides</h2>
            <p>Landslides can occur in various forms, depending on the materials involved and the nature of the movement:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Debris Flows:</strong> Rapid movement of loose soil, rocks, and organic material down a slope.</li>
                <li><strong>Rockfalls:</strong> Sudden and rapid free fall of rocks from a steep slope or cliff.</li>
                <li><strong>Slumps:</strong> A type of landslide where a mass of earth or rock moves down a slope along a curved surface.</li>
                <li><strong>Creep:</strong> Slow, gradual downhill movement of soil or rock, often imperceptible over short periods.</li>
                <li><strong>Lateral Spreads:</strong> Movement of large, coherent masses of soil or rock that spread out laterally.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="effects">
            <h2>Effects of Landslides</h2>
            <p>Landslides can have a range of effects on the environment and human life:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Property Damage:</strong> Landslides can destroy homes, buildings, and infrastructure, leading to significant economic losses.</li>
                <li><strong>Loss of Life:</strong> Landslides can be deadly, particularly in areas where people are caught off guard by the sudden movement of debris.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Landslides can alter landscapes, disrupt ecosystems, and block rivers, leading to flooding.</li>
                <li><strong>Transportation Disruption:</strong> Landslides can block roads, railways, and other transportation routes, causing major disruptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary Disasters:</strong> Landslides can trigger secondary disasters such as floods or tsunamis if they occur near water bodies.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Landslide Safety Tips</h2>
            <p>Knowing how to prepare for and respond to a landslide can save lives. Here are some safety tips:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Know the Risk:</strong> If you live in a landslide-prone area, be aware of the risks and stay informed about weather conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare an Emergency Kit:</strong> Include essentials like water, food, flashlights, a first-aid kit, and important documents.</li>
                <li><strong>Evacuate if Advised:</strong> Follow evacuation orders from local authorities immediately.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Hazardous Areas:</strong> Stay away from steep slopes, cliffs, and other areas prone to landslides, especially during heavy rain.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Monitor weather forecasts and landslide warnings, and be prepared to act quickly.</li>
            </ol>
