            <h2>What is a Tornado?</h2>
            <p>A tornado is a rapidly rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground. Tornadoes are capable of causing extensive damage with their strong winds, which can exceed 300 mph (480 km/h). They often appear as a funnel-shaped cloud and are known for their violent and unpredictable nature.</p>

            <h2>Causes of Tornadoes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thunderstorm Development:</strong> Tornadoes usually form from severe thunderstorms, particularly those with a rotating updraft known as a mesocyclone.</li>
                <li><strong>Wind Shear:</strong> The presence of varying wind speeds and directions at different altitudes creates the conditions necessary for tornado formation.</li>
                <li><strong>Temperature Contrast:</strong> Significant temperature differences between air masses can contribute to the development of tornadoes.</li>
                <li><strong>Topography:</strong> Certain geographical features can influence the formation and movement of tornadoes by altering wind patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Climate Conditions:</strong> Tornadoes are more common in regions with a suitable climate, such as the central United States known as "Tornado Alley."</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="types">
            <h2>Types of Tornadoes</h2>
            <p>Tornadoes can be classified based on their intensity and appearance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Funnel Cloud:</strong> A tornado that does not reach the ground. It appears as a rotating, vertical cloud but lacks contact with the surface.</li>
                <li><strong>Landspout:</strong> A tornado that forms from a convective cloud but is not associated with a supercell. It often appears as a skinny, short-lived tornado.</li>
                <li><strong>Waterspout:</strong> A tornado that forms over water and can move to land. Waterspouts can be weaker than their land counterparts but can still cause significant damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-Vortex Tornado:</strong> A tornado with multiple smaller vortices rotating around a common center, which can increase the overall destructive power.</li>
                <li><strong>Supertornado:</strong> A rare and extremely powerful tornado with winds exceeding 300 mph (480 km/h), causing the most severe damage.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        
        <section class="effects">
            <h2>Effects of Tornadoes</h2>
            <p>Tornadoes can have devastating effects on both the environment and human infrastructure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Structural Damage:</strong> Tornadoes can demolish buildings, uproot trees, and toss debris over long distances.</li>
                <li><strong>Injuries and Fatalities:</strong> The intense winds and flying debris from tornadoes pose serious risks to people and animals, leading to injuries and fatalities.</li>
                <li><strong>Displacement:</strong> Tornadoes can displace communities, leaving residents without homes and essential services.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Impact:</strong> The cost of repairs and recovery after a tornado can be substantial, affecting local and regional economies.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Tornadoes can alter landscapes, destroy natural habitats, and affect local ecosystems.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tornado Safety Tips</h2>
            <p>To protect yourself and your family during a tornado, follow these safety tips:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Seek Shelter:</strong> Find a safe location such as a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. Avoid windows and exterior walls.</li>
                <li><strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Monitor weather reports and tornado warnings through a weather radio or mobile app to stay updated on the stormâ€™s progress.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare an Emergency Kit:</strong> Keep essential supplies such as food, water, medications, and a flashlight in your emergency kit.</li>
                <li><strong>Have a Plan:</strong> Create a tornado safety plan for your family and practice regular drills to ensure everyone knows what to do in case of a tornado.</li>
                <li><strong>During a Tornado:</strong> If caught outside or in a vehicle, seek shelter in a low-lying area or ditch. Avoid seeking shelter under overpasses or bridges.</li>
